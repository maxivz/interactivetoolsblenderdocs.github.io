When off the gizmo is hidden after the scale gizmo Documentation: New documentation BL Info: Added links to new documentation and bug tracker 1.3 2020-02-20 Super Smart Create: Revamped Object Creation Pie: Allows selection between qblocker and normal objects Added camera, light and gpencil and empties Quick Pipe: First implementation, makes a quick pipe from the selected edges Mouse left/Right changes size of pipe Transform Orientation Pies: Pie menu for pivot orientation, stores 3 custom pivot orientations Snap Presets Pie: First Implementation, adds 4 snapping presets that are commonly used while modeling Prop Edit Pie: Implemented Control proportional editing settings from this pie. Smart Modify Pie: Implemented Tool Context sensitive pie, that brings up relevant tools based on the context. Transform: Added CS Move, CS Rotate and CS Scale CS Move When executed if you are in a different transform mode it will bring up the respective gizmo. If you are in the move transform mode it will execute the grab tool. CS Rotate When executed if you are in a different transform mode it will bring up the respective gizmo. If you are in the move transform mode it will execute the gizmoless rotate tool. CS Scale When executed if you are in a different transform mode it will bring up the respective gizmo. If you are in the move transform mode it will execute the resize tool. Radial Symmetry: Fixed another Bug that caused the symmetry to be misaligned Quick Selection: It now works with Lattices and Grease Pencil objects Edit Origin: For version 2.82 and up it now uses the default blender origin edition tool, which supports rotation and does not create an empty If you are in edit mode it will now switch to object mode before editing the origin Smart Extrude: A new version of this tool is available. The old version was renamed Smart Extrude Legacy and can be accessed if enabled in the Preferences. The new version uses blender default translation tools, enabling snapping and precise axis control. It remembers what transform tool you were using and executes it after doing the extrude. So it now works with Movement, Rotation and Scale. Contexts work as they used to: If in object mode it will duplicate the object and transform. If in edge selection mode it will extend and transform If in vert or face selection mode it will duplicate and transform If you are in edit mode of a curve, it will extend the curve and transform Setup for executing the tool with shift+drag. Side Panel: The SidePanel has been updated with the new tools. Smart Extrude Legacy & Smart Translate Legacy: These Tools are now considered Legacy tools and are no longer in development. You can still access them by enabling the legacy tools in the preferences.

If you are in segment selection mode it will switch to object mode. Sticky Selection Sticky selection refeers to keeping the selection stored between different selection modes in a similar way to what 3ds Max does. Interactive Tool's Sticky Selection implementation works by storing the selected verts, edges or faces as a custom attribute, for this to happen you need to enable Sticky Selection in the preferences and use Quick Vert, Edge and Face or Selection Cycle to move between modes. While this feature works most of the times, doing a lot of operations that modifies the order of the elements and forces blender to recalculate it, like extruding, beveling, etc will break the tool. Smart Loop If two continuous edges or one edge is selected, the edge loop is going to be selected. If two edges are selected, it's going to get the edge loop between them. If three edges are selected, and they have the same space between them a step selection will be made. These modes work with multiple selections at the same time. Support for vertex and face mode is limited, but some modes work. Smart Ring If two continuous edges or one edge is selected, the edge ring is going to be selected. If two edges are selected, it's going to get the edge ring between them, If three edges are selected, and they have the same space between them a step selection will be made. These modes work with multiple selections at the same time. Support for vertex and face mode is limited, but some modes work. There is a known bug with ring selections not working sometimes, a fix will be released on the future.","title":"Selection"},{"location":"selection/#selection","text":"","title":"Selection"},{"location":"selection/#quick-vert-mode","text":"","title":"Quick Vert Mode"},{"location":"selection/#mesh-mode","text":"If you are in object mode it will switch to vert selection mode.

Object Mode Brings up an object creation Pie Menu if nothing is selected. Bring up a duplication menu if at least a object is selected. Vert Mode If Nothing is selected it executes the cut tool. Connects verts that belong to the same face. If you select one vert or two verts that share the same edge and are on a border it will invoke f2 (make sure you have f2 enabled) If you select multiple verts that belong to the same face, they will all be connected to the last selected vert. Edge Mode If nothing is selected it invokes the edge loop tool If you select an edge it will divide it in 2, putting a vert in the middle of the edge Connects the selected edges if they are part of a ring. Caps selected borders Bridges selected edges if possible When you select 2 adjacent edges it creates a face Face Mode Bridges selected polys If a single face is selected it will try to make quads on it This last feature works pretty good if you select a border, run the script to make a face and then run the script again to make quads out of it: When Mmltiple connected faces are selected they will be subdivided Curve Mode If one point is selected it will extrude it If two unconnected points are selected it will connect them If two connected points are selected it will make a segment between them Smart Delete Vert Mode If a vert is selected it will delete all the connected faces.

If the tool is run in edit mode while in edge mode the selected edges will be extruded and the transform tool that was being used is ran. If the tool is run in edit mode while in face mode the selected the faces will be duplicated and the transform tool that was being used is ran. If the tool is run in edit curve mode while in point mode the selected the points will be duplicated and the transform tool that was being used is ran. Legacy Method The legacy mode of this tool can be activated in the preferences . The main feature of the legacy mode is automatic axis detectionbut it only works with the move tool and its behaivour isnt consistent. Mouse Drag Setup For mouse drag behaivour set up a new hotkey as shown in the picture below. The 3d View Tool is a good context to set the tool under, but this can be done under any context. Quick Origin Edit Mode Centers the origin on selection for vert, edge and face mode. Object Mode Works as well for object mode, centering the origin on the object. Quick Edit Origin Current Mode This mode only works in versions newer than 2.82 Toggles edit origin mode on and off. Legacy Mode For blender 2.82 and below the tool will run in legacy mode. This mode can also be enabled in newer versions of blender in the preferences . Select an object and run the tool, a helper will be made to control the origin position. If the selected object already has a helper on the scene the existing helper will be selected. With the helper selected run the tool to apply the new origin position to the object. Quick Align If an object is selected hover the cursor over the target and run to tool to align the mesh to the target. If an object is selected and no mesh is under the cursor the mesh will be aligned to the world. The settings menu can be used to align to specific axes. Quick Pipe Makes a Pipe from an edge selection, can also be run on existing pipes to continue editing. Move Left/Right to controls the thickness of the pipe. Ctrl + Mouse Left/Right controls the resolution of the pipe. Quick Lattice If a selection is made a lattice that fits the selection will appear. This works in Object mode as well If the object is selected and the tool is run when a lattice already exists then the existing lattice will be selected. If the lattice is selected and the tool is run lattice will be applied and the object will be selected. Rebase Cylinder Move Left/Right to controls the resolution of the cylinder. Ctrl + Mouse Left/Right controls the axis in which the cylinder is calculated. M to change between different merge distance presets Select a loop in a cylindrical object and run the tool to make a copy of the shape with customizable number of sides. The tool can be run on rebased cylinders to continue editing after they have been created as long as the modifiers havent been collapsed. Radial Symmetry Move the mouse to the left and the right the amount of iterations will increase and decrease. Control + mouse movement changes the symmetry axis. H To Show/Hide the symmetry Origin. Select an object and run the tool. A radial symmetry will be created using the object's pivot point as the center point. Select an object that already had radial symmetry to continue editing it. Unhide the Symmetry Pivot and move it around to further modify the radial symmetry. CS Slide Vert Mode If the vert mode it will execute vert slide. Edge Mode If the edge mode it will execute edge slide. CS Bevel Vert Mode If the vert mode is selected it will execute the vertex bevel tool. Edge Mode If the edge mode it selected it will execute the edge bevel tool. Face Mode If the face mode is selected it will execute the extrude faces tool. Quick HP Lp Namer Finds the lowest poly mesh in the selection and adds the low poly suffix to it, then proceeds to name all the high poly meshes with the low poly name adding the high poly prefix. The prefix for the low and high poly mesh can be changed in the plugin settings.","title":"Tools"},{"location":"tools/#smart-tools","text":"Customizable context sensitive tools that pack multiple functions in one hotkey","title":"Smart Tools"},{"location":"tools/#super-smart-create","text":"This tool executes many creation based operations depending on the context and selection, allowing to pack a lot of actions in one hotkey.","title":"Super Smart Create"},{"location":"tools/#object-mode","text":"Brings up an object creation Pie Menu if nothing is selected.
